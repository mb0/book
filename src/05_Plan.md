Action Plan
===========

With all the newfound insights, what can we do to save worlds?

You need to find your way before you can help others find theirs. Start to live consciously and
choose your goals and principles. You must decide the path for your own journey. I urge you to [wake
up](./02_Wakeup.md), but even doubling down on self-serving goals is better than doing nothing.

Waking up is gradual process. Strive to be kind and forgiving to others and yourself. Get to know
your self, practice and test your abilities. By walking the path prosperously you can already be an
inspirations to others. You clear the path through an overgrown thicket where others can follow.

Further along the path you will be in a position to help more effectively. It is easier to extend a
helping hand or throw a life line from higher ground. If you find yourself in the company of other
waking individuals you can think about coordinating.
