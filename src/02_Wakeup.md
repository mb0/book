How to Wake Up
==============

Waking up could be called self-actualisation and describes the gradual process of becoming whole or
holy &mdash; if you will. This goal is to help others. The effect is ultimately true bliss.

The self serving path is not to be confused with waking up. It involves that you take what you want
for yourself without regard for others harmed by your actions. The desired thing might be power, sex
or knowledge. But when you reach these goals you might realise you really needed respect, love and
wisdom all along.

Often persons that wake up try to communicate found insights to people in their sphere of influence.
We all to often praise them and call them famous musicians, great heroes, and holy saints[^1]. Or we
ridicule, oppress[^2] or kill[^3][^4] them. The message is often simple and plausible, but
dangerous nonetheless.

Other people see the potential of waking consciousness. And try to emulate someone, that has
previously found a way, and walk in their footsteps on the same path. Using a life story as recipe
or template in that way can be helpful, but everyone still needs to decide their own fate with each
step. Delegating decision to scripture, custom or other people, without understanding the reasons,
is often counterproductive.

It is good to try to understand the stories in holy books of various religions, as well as studying
sciences and practicing creativity to some extent. But the author himself learned life lessons, and
self reflection while completing[^5] a computer game saga called `Binding of Isaac: Rebirth`[^6].
Even though it is a great game, it certainly is not right for everybody. The important takeaway here
is that opportunities to progress on your path can be found everywhere you look.

You have probably seen this picture[^7] before. But what does it mean to really understand it? Have
you read about German Idealism[^8], Jungian archetypes[^9] or heard about the arguments that our
reality is an illusion[^10]?
