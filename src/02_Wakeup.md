How to Wake Up
==============

Waking up could be called self-actualisation and describes the gradual process of becoming whole or
holy &mdash; if you will. This goal is to be self-less. The effect is ultimately true bliss. You
have to save your own world first, in order to save the world of others.

The self serving path is not to be confused with waking up. It involves that you take what you want
for yourself without regard for others harmed by your actions. The desired thing might be power, sex
or knowledge. But when you reach these goals you might realise you really needed respect, love and
wisdom all along. The ego aids your survival in the beginning, but later distracts from your real
objective.

Often persons, that wake up, try to communicate found insights to people in their sphere of
influence. We all to often praise them and call them famous musicians, great heroes, and holy
saints[^1]. Or we ridicule, oppress[^2] or kill[^3][^4] them. The message is often simple and
plausible, but dangerous nonetheless.

Other people see the potential of waking consciousness and try to walk the same path as someone,
that has previously found a way. Using a life story as recipe or template in that way can be
helpful, but everyone still needs to decide their own fate with each step. Delegating decision to
scripture, custom or other people, without understanding the reasons, is often counterproductive.

It is good to try to understand the stories in holy books of various religions, as well as studying
sciences and practicing creativity. But the author himself learned life lessons, especially patience
while completing[^5] a rogue-lite[^6] computer game saga called `Binding of Isaac: Rebirth`[^7].
Even though it is a great game, it certainly is not right for everybody. The important takeaway here
is that opportunities to progress on your path can be found everywhere you look.

Reflection and intuition are the most resourceful guides on your path through life. Make good use of
them! But beware that you have to calm your ego, in order to listen to your heart. Various cultures
manifest their inner voice as angels, spirit animals or in other guises during meditation, in order
to converse with it.

Be stubborn if other people try to change your path, if you know the way to be true.
Consider what they say, but also observe how the live and what they do.
Be generally weary of other peoples opinions, many are confused, others have no clue.

You have probably seen this picture[^8] before. But what does it mean to really understand it? Have
you read about German Idealism[^9], Jungian archetypes[^10] or heard about the arguments that our
reality is an illusion[^11]? The lesson is, that even if someone would tell you all the answers,
you would still need to formulate the right questions and invest to understand the reply.

To summarize: Your destination is peace, love and happiness. You have to walk the path yourselves.
The way is to calm down your ego to hear your inner voice guiding you to be self-less and at peace.
Be steadfast on your path and avoid distractions, but reflect yourself and consider criticism.

Have fun!
