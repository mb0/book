How to Wake Up
==============

Often persons that wake up try to communicate found insights to people in their sphere of influence.
We all to often praise them and call them famous musicians, holy prophets, and great heroes. Or we
ridicule, censor, chastise or imprison them. The message is often simple and plausible, but
dangerous nonetheless.

Other people see the potential of waking consciousness. And try to emulate someone, that has
previously found a way, and walk in their footsteps on the same path. Using a life story as recipe
or template in that way can be helpful, but everyone still needs to decide their own fate with each
step. Delegating decision to scripture, custom or other people, without understanding the reasons,
is often counter productive.

Sections the author intends to cover:

 * Reflection, internal versus external
 * Letting go, finding calmness and eventually peace
