How Reality Works
=================

It is not not possible to explain everything (as will soon become clear), but we can contemplate our
immediate, personal, subjective experience or what we call reality in this chapter.

> "I think therefor I am" &mdash; Ren√© Descartes 1637[^1]

This thought logically leads one to consider Solipsism[^2]. The author had this thought as a young
child after a transformative "dream" experience. After asking the big sister, how we can be sure if
what we see is not also a dream, if dreams can be so very different and still feel real, she made
it clear, that thoughts like this are for egoists. It rightfully offends other conscious beings if
we treat them like less. As with most things, consciousness is a spectrum. Bacteria, trees, squids
and dogs and we  ourselves are all conscious to some degree.

Dreams
------

What makes your reality more real than your dreams? You would probably say that things happening in
dreams have no lasting effect outside the dream. But is this really true? Did you ever understand
something in your sleep after a long night of studying? Mendeleev got the insights for the periodic
table[^3] and Paul McCartney composed the song Yesterday[^4] while dreaming. Many other thoughts
were dreamt that have a lasting effect outside of dreams.

Many dreams are of stress scenarios, to revisit or prepare situations in your lives; to process
experiences and prepare future decisions. Sometimes dreams can be precognizant[^5] and revisit
future events. Sometimes dreams are shared with a close friend or total stranger. Some people have
learned to take conscious control of their dreams[^6].

There are different kinds of dreams, that mostly have one thing in common: We seem to have some
creative control over the dream scenario. Even if do not consciously decide the scenario or
understand the connection to ourselves, the symbolism that dreams use arise from our own mind.

Reality
-------

Reality is in many aspects very similar to continuous shared dream. We all have an individual
exclusive perspective and focus of attention on this shared experience. Because the scenario is
shared and participants are not fully cooperative yet, changing the shared dream environment
requires energy, that is basically attention.

If you played computer games think of it this way: Your dreams at night are mostly like single
player games, where you are free to load a scenario and explore and change the world. If you are
lucid dreaming, you have loaded the file in the game development environment. Some games are mostly
single player, but other souls can interact by leaving notes or visiting. However there are also
massive multi player games with thousands of players sharing one scenario. All multi player games
between strangers have some problem with harassment and vandalism. Most games need to provide some
creative limits of players to keep the shared scenario intact. That can be in the form of anti-cheat
measures, restricted or no communication, fenced of creative spaces, griefer[^7] protection.

We can immerse ourselves in games or other fictional worlds, but there is a fundamental limit to our
immersion. Even with the latest in virtual reality technology we still know of the reality and our
existence outside the virtual scenario.

Most people born on earth forget their existence outside the life here willingly as a requirement to
experience this world. This is not only to immerse ourselves, but to be able to have an fresh and
untainted perspective, to be unburden from guilt or strongly held beliefs, to learn new things about
themselves and others.


TODO: explore optical illusions, gorilla experiment, Dan Brown, but also the Miracle of the Sun,
levitation of monks and saints.

TODO: explore mind altering rituals, traumas, psychoactive substances, autism spectrum.

TODO: consensus reality, shared space-time symbolism as a framework for collaboration

Let us continue with this clip about Plato's cave[^8].

There are many books, courses and videos that explain the allegory in more detail. One accessible
example is this well recorded [university lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBPd7getIcM).

There are lots of plays, songs and movies alluding to the same concept. The author certainly watched
movies like The Cube('97)[^9], The Truman Show('98)[^10], The Matrix('99)[^11].

TODO: point out the important details often missed and their implications and how to change reality
