How Reality Works
=================

It is not not possible to explain everything (as will soon become clear), but we can contemplate our
immediate, personal, subjective experience or what we call in reality this chapter.

> "I think therefor I am" &mdash; Ren√© Descartes 1637[^1]

This thought logically leads one to consider Solipsism[^2]. The author had this thought as a young
child after a transformative dream experience. After asking the big sister, how we can be sure if
what we see is not also a dream, when dreams can be so very different and still feel real, she made
it clear that thoughts like this are for egoists. It rightfully offends other conscious beings if we
treat them like less. As with most things, consciousness is a spectrum. Bacteria, trees, squids and
dogs and we are all conscious to some degree.

What makes your reality more real than your dreams? You would probably say that things happening in
dreams have no lasting effect outside the dream. But is this really true? Did you ever understand
something in your sleep after a long night of studying? Mendeleev got the insights for the periodic
table[^3] and Paul McCartney composed the song Yesterday[^4] while dreaming. Many other thoughts
were dreamt that have a lasting effect outside of dreams.

Many dreams are of stress scenarios, to revisit or prepare situations in your lives; to process
experiences and prepare future decisions. Sometimes dreams can be precognizant[^5] and revisit
future events. Sometimes dreams are shared with a close friend or total stranger. Some people have
learned to take conscious control of their dreams[^6].

TODO: explore optical illusions, gorilla experiment, Dan Brown, but also the Miracle of the Sun,
levitation of monks and saints.

TODO: explore mind altering rituals, traumas, psychoactive substances, autism spectrum.

TODO: consensus reality, shared space-time symbolism as a framework for collaboration

Let us continue with this clip about Plato's cave[^7].

There are many books, courses and videos that explain the allegory in more detail. One accessible
example is this well recorded [university lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBPd7getIcM).

There are lots of plays, songs and movies alluding to the same concept. The author certainly watched
movies like The Cube('97)[^8], The Truman Show('98)[^9], The Matrix('99)[^10].

TODO: point out the important details often missed and their implications and how to change reality
