Your Mission
============

Your mission here on earth is to be kind and patient with others that can't bring themselves to be
kind to you.

The reason we are all here varies but the primary objective is to get started on a path towards
growth of ourselves individually and as a whole collectively. There are different ways to wake up to
this new perspective on life. You can reach it through meditation, dance, sports, music or any of
the arts or the appreciation thereof or a combination of those and other things. Anything can be
practiced as a form of art if done consciously.

You can find truth and wisdom in the most beautiful but also in the hateful and profane things. You
can also grok these ideas intellectually and arrive at something like the price equation. The
equation shows that there are to extremes in biological evolution. One extreme is the selfless part
of a collective swarm mind. The other extreme is a dominating individual that commands other
conscious beings.

So the whole truth is that earth is a scenario for you to decide which path to take in a way. Both
paths will lead to transcendence eventually. But this is very important: the default option is not
to even try the first steps.
