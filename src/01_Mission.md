Your Mission
============

Your mission here on earth is to be kind and patient with others that can't bring themselves to be
kind to you.

The reason we are all here varies but the primary objective is to get started on a path towards
growth of ourselves individually and as a whole collectively. There are different ways to wake up to
this new perspective on life. You can reach it through meditation, dance, sports, music or any of
the arts or the appreciation thereof or a combination of those and other things. Anything can be
practiced as a form of art if done consciously.

You can find truth and wisdom in the most beautiful but also in the hateful and profane things. You
can also grok these ideas intellectually and arrive at something like the Price equation[^1][^2].
The equation shows that there are to extremes in biological evolution. One extreme is the selfless
part of a collective swarm mind. The other extreme is a dominating individual that commands other
conscious beings.

So the whole truth is that earth is a scenario for you to decide which path[^3] to take in a way.
Both paths will lead to transcendence. But this is very important: the default option is not to even
try the first steps. It is human to go astray and be lost. It will only a detour in hindsight, with
valuable experiences along the way, as long as keep moving and find your own way out.

While the self centered path seems comfortable, sweet and enticing. It is filled with other self
serving people. You may find joys, thrills and satisfactions, but not true love and happiness.
The narrow path may look harder on the first glance, but your legs and feet will soon adjust.
Whenever you falter and stumble kind strangers will help you on your way. And if we keep using this
picture, we can see bridges connecting both paths into the far distance, that is ultimately bridged
by a colorful rainbow of light.

This all sounds so corny, kitchy, trivial, worn-out, trite and banal. Like the mantras of thousands
of years of prayers and songs that end up as empty symbols on our kitchen magnets. The challenge for
everyone to discover the meaning behind those words and apply them to their own lives.
