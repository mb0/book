Hello You!

My name is not really important, but I am a Human and are called Martin. Through complicated life
circumstance I woke up to a new reality right here on earth as many other before and after me.

I currently channel my higher self and want to share some insights that came up since I woke up.

Overview
--------

I am not yet sure how to structure this and have an intuition that we need a hypertext linked
system rather than a collection of version controlled text files. My wish would be to have a root
node with a short macro-overview and introduction where people can drill down into the micro-details
and analogies.

 * Your Mission
 * How to Wake Up
 * Waking Up
 * How Reality Works
 * What is God
 * Positive Outlook

Contribute
----------

I will try to write down some of the fundamental views if I find the time. I hope that other
contribute their side of the story and tell the background circumstances that led to my situation.

Everybody is invited to discuss, suggest and correct spelling errors.
